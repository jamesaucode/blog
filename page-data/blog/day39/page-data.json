Hurray! I have no classes on Friday, so Friday is usually my dedicated coding day.(To be fair, whenever I have freetime I will either watch video about coding or actually code :p). I spent the day creating this blog. I know this is easy for a lot of people, but for a new programmer like me, I am extremely happy for this. I very much prefer simple and clean layout, that's why the blog does not look fancy at all. But it does the job(at least I think it does, for now)\nThe blog is not fully functional yet. This is by no means completed. There is still a lot to do on this blog. There are plenty of blog hosting websites, but it is much more satisfying to build one on my own. This is a fun little project that I will keep sticking to. At the moment , only blog, about page and error page are functional.\n\nTime log of today:\n\n__7pm : Woke up__\n\n__8pm - 11pm : Went for coffee, rearranged the layout of the blog.__\n\n__11pm - 12pm : Eat, relax__\n\n__12pm-3pm : Added reponsive design on the website. Read up how to do client-side routing.__\n\n__3pm - 3:45pm : Took a nap.__\n\n__3:45pm - 8:35pm : Continued learning how to properly route my website. Created an about page. Learnt how to publish it on github to show it to people__\n\nWhat I have to figure out/ do:\n\n__Complete the home page__\n\n__Ability to login to the website as admin.(possibly optional?)__\n\n__Make a text editor for the website (features like bold, set font-size etc. Or at the very least, set the blog post's title and type out the paragraph)__\n\n__Post , and store data on the website.__\n\n__Correctly route the blog posts (For instance blog/39 to day 39)__\n\n__I also want to create a timer app, it will be a fun little project.__\n\nTime to take a rest :)"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"day39"}}}
