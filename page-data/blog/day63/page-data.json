I got a mild headache, and runny nose. I thought it was just my hayfever acting up, so I went to school at 730am as usual. I was wrong, it only got worse..\n\nI started sneezing every 10 seconds (no kidding), I have to constantly go to the bathroom for more tissues. I managed to make it through 2 classes. Afterwards, I went to the coffee shop and coded until 7pm and went home. I felt really good that day, psychologically, because I persisted. I stick to my commitment even though I was ill. I know this might sound a bit dramatic, but I have never been that determined to school and coding. I would have given myself an excuse and slacked off for the rest of the day.\n\nDay 64 was much better. I had a really nice sleep from 10pm to 630am. I revisited my blog ('s code), I found out the blog posts were not sorted in order, so I did \n> this.state.post.sort((post1,post2) => {\n>   return post2.fields.order > post1.fields.order}).map ....\n \nYay, Javascript knowledge payed off (even though its probably trivial for most of the people :p).\n\nI am still trying to get a hang of Redux at the moment. In the next project, I will start using Redux and build a more complex web app. Meanwhile, I will keep reading and practicing my vanilla javascript. \n"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"day63"}}}
