Create a link on the Homepage, which links to mypage/blog/{day}\n3. Brings user to the right url, displaying only the blog post that was selected\n\nI feel so dumb when I finally figured out I wasn't passing any of the props from React Router to the blog page. I was wondering why it keeps saying my match. is not defined. Then I realized I forgot to pass it to the next component. \n\nWell, at least I learnt something :p Now I actually have a functional blog that I can use. Next step is to fix the side bar, so it will actually show what is the previous and next post. Then, I might move on to another projet I had in mind. In the next project, I am going to try and learn a backend language and actually implement a login system. I am excited to start it! \n\nI am going to head off and learn some more python(been fun so far btw), do some reading and sleep. This is what I love about programming: the feeling of finally solving a problem. No matter how dumb it looks in retrospect :p\n"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"day49"}}}
