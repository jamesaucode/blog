I followed Djangogirls' guide to build a blog with just Django. (Awesome guide btw, check it out! [Link](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) ) Initially, I looked up Django guide because I heard it can be used as backend in combination with React, and I wanted to learn more Python to prepare for next year's Python data structure class. I actually enjoyed writing in Django and Python! Codes written in Python just looks really clean. I also started reading 'Learning Python the hard way'. The idea of typing out all the code, without understanding it first is pretty interesting, and I can see it actually working. I am going to commit at least half an hour everyday reading it. I probably shouldn't wander around with other languages that much at this stage. I guess today was a more relaxing day where I get to explore a little bit, instead of grinding on JS, React and CSS. Still, I definitely think today is a fruitful day. I am glad I started coding, I am now absolutely hooked. I woke up at 7am and coded until just now (10pm), and I don't feel bored at all. I can't wait to start my next computer science class."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"day54"}}}
