Now I am actually able to start using this blog! I can actually use a text editor instead of typing the blog with html tags like an idiot :p Next step is to link separate blog to separate url parameters. Hopefully it will be done tomorrow. \n\nSchool starts tomorrow .. again. It's gonna be 2 classes in 1 session again, because I wanna be as available as possible in my senior year, so I can focus more on coding. The more I do coding challenges, the more I realize how bad my fundamentals are, which is a good thing! I make a lot of stupid mistakes, but I am also learning in the process. This is one of my favorite thing about coding: there's always new things to learn, and the satisfaction of solving a problem you have been stuck is unparalleled :D"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"day48"}}}
